# React app with MongoDB using Google Books API

### User can search for books via the Google Books API and render them here. User has the option to "View" a book, bringing them to the book on Google Books, or "Save" a book, saving it to the Mongo database.

### The save page renders all books saved to the Mongo database. User has an option to "View" the book, bringing them to the book on Google Books, or "Delete" a book, removing it from the Mongo database.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
